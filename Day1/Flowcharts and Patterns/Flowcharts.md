Q1. Average of three numbers : You are given three numbers. You need to calculate and print their average value. Draw a flowchart for this process.

Q2. Check Number : You are given a single number. You need to print one of the following outputs according to the number's nature. Print 1, if the number is positive. Print -1, if it's negative. Print 0, if it's equal to 0. Draw a flowchart for this process.

Q3. Valid Triangle : You are given 3 numbers. Each number represents the length of a line. You need to figure out whether these lines can form a valid triangle. If a valid triangle can be formed, print "Yes", otherwise print "No". Draw a flowchart for this process. A triangle is a valid triangle, If and only If, the sum of any two sides of a triangle is greater than the third side. For Example, let A, B and C are three sides of a triangle. Then, A + B > C, B + C > A and C + A > B.

Q4. Find Product : You are given a single non-negative integer, N. You need to calculate and print N factorial (N!). N factorial is defined as the product of all integers from 1 to N (both inclusive). Draw a flowchart for this process.

Q5. Print Even Numbers : You are given a single positive integer, N. You need to print all even integers that occur between 1 and N (both inclusive). Draw a flowchart for this process.

Q6. Check triangle : You are given the lengths of 3 sides of a valid triangle. You need to print any one of the following outputs depending on the triangle's nature. Print 1, if the triangle is equilateral. Print 0, if it's isosceles. Print -1, if it's scalene. Draw a flowchart for this process.
Note: Equilateral : A triangle with all sides of equal length, Isosceles: A triangle with two sides of equal length and two angles of equal measure, Scalene: A triangle with no sides of equal length.

Q7. Sum of evens : You are given a single positive integer, N. You need to calculate and print the sum of all even numbers till N(inclusive). Draw a flowchart for this process.

Q8. Find GCD : You are given two numbers. You need to calculate and print their greatest common divisor (GCD). Draw a flowchart for this process.

Q9. Check Prime number : You are given a single positive integer, N. You need to find and print whether N is Prime or not. Draw a flowchart for this process.

Q10. All fibonacci numbers : You are given a single non-negative integer, N. You need to print all numbers that: (i) occur in the range 0 to N (both inclusive). (ii) are a part of the fibonacci sequence. Draw a flowchart for this process.
Note : The first two terms of the fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1.

Q11. Member of Fibonacci : You are given a single non-negative integer, N. You need to find out whether N is a part of the fibonacci sequence. Print "Yes" if it is and "No" if it's not. Draw a flowchart for this process.
Note : The first two terms of the fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1.
